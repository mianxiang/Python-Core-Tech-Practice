2.9 Generators
Use generators as needed.



2.9 Definition
A generator function returns an iterator that yields a value each time it executes a yield statement. After it yields a value, the runtime state of the generator function is suspended until the next value is needed.



2.9.2 Pros
Simpler code, because the state of local variables and control flow are preserved for each call. A generator uses less memory than a function that creates an entire list of values at once.



2.9.3 Cons
None.



2.9.4 Decision
Fine. Use “Yields:” rather than “Returns:” in the docstring for generator functions
